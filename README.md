# Analog Synthesizer Panels

This repo contains all the source files from my custom built [MFOS](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1854&VPH=866) Modular Analog Synthesizer project.

- [Sketch layout](https://github.com/LukeLabs/analog-synthesizer-panels/tree/master/MFOS) - Contains artwork for the VCO, VCF12/24, ADSR, VCA and LFO modules.
The panels were originally printed on 3mm thick Aluminium at a size of 90mm x 222mm for 2U wide and 45mm x 222mm for 1U wide.

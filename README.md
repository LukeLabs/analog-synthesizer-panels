# Analog Synthesizer Panels

This repo contains all the source files from my custom built, [Music From Outer Space](http://musicfromouterspace.com/index.php?MAINTAB=SYNTHDIY&VPW=1854&VPH=866) modular analog synthesizer.

## Contents

- [Sketch layout](https://github.com/LukeLabs/analog-synthesizer-panels/tree/master/MFOS) - Contains artwork for the following modules:

  - VCO: Voltage Controller Oscillator
  - VCF 12: 12dB Voltage Controlled Filter
  - VCF 24: 24dB Voltage Controlled Filter
  - 1U Master: A base 1U layout for new modules
  - ADSR: Attack/Delay/Sustain/Release envelope generator
  - VCA: Voltage Controlled Amplifier
  - LFO: Low Frequency Oscillator
  - MULTI: A 4x4x4x4/8x8 passive multiplier
  - LEVEL: A three channel, passive level attenuator with single channel passthrough
  - POWER: A simple power panel for dual supply rails + power switch
  - DMOD: Delayed Modulation
  - S&H: Sample and Hold

## How to use these files

1. Import the included Sketch file into your local copy of Sketch.
1. Customise the panels where desired.
1. Print with your favourite laser printer.
1. Use your favourite toner transfer method to transfer the design onto Aluminium.

## Warnings

- These panels were originally printed on 3 mm thick Aluminium at a size of 90 mm x 222 mm for 2U wide and 45 mm x 222 mm for 1U wide.  This is slightly _smaller_ than the official RU standard, but makes layout and printing easier.
- The mounting holes are 3 mm from the edge of the panel.  You may want to double-check this will fit into your rack before printing and/or cutting.
